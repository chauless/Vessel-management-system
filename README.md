# Vessel-management-system

The project has the idea of a global database,
which contains information about ports of each country and their description,
ship owners/companies that can build and register ships under their ownership,
information about the ships, the home port of each ship, an up-to-date list of crew members,
and seafarers who are also nationals of a particular country.
and the vessel they are currently working on.

# Structure:

1. Countries (shipowners, ports, ships, seafarers)
2. Ports (country ,ships)
2. Shipowners (country, ships)
3. Vessels (country, shipowner, port (registrations), seafarers)
4. Seamen (country (citizenship), ship, shipowner (as in ship)))
